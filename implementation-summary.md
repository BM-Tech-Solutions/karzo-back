# Implementation Summary

## Changes Completed

### Backend Changes
1. **Interview Model Updates**
   - Added `conversation_id` field for report generation
   - Added `report_id` field to store generated report IDs
   - Added `report_status` field to track report generation status
   - Added `created_at` field for interview creation timestamp

2. **API Endpoint Additions**
   - Added `/api/company/candidates/passed` endpoint to get candidates who passed interviews
   - Implemented the corresponding CRUD function `get_passed_candidates_by_job_offers`

3. **Bug Fixes**
   - Fixed the `transform_job_offer_to_dict` function to properly handle the `db` parameter
   - Made the `db` parameter optional with a default value of `None`
   - Updated all function calls to pass the `db` parameter

4. **Migration Script**
   - Created a migration script to add the new fields to the Interview model

### Frontend Changes
1. **Candidate Page Updates**
   - Modified to use existing endpoint with filtering instead of the new endpoint
   - Added proper error handling for missing fields

2. **Interview Page Updates**
   - Made report generation conditional on backend support
   - Added checks for required fields before showing report buttons

3. **Layout Changes**
   - Removed navbar from application and interview pages
   - Removed "Return to Home" button from thank you page

## Next Steps

1. **Apply Database Migration**
   - Run `alembic upgrade head` to apply the new migration

2. **Test Backend Endpoints**
   - Test the new `/api/company/candidates/passed` endpoint
   - Verify that the existing endpoints work with the updated models

3. **Implement Report Generation Backend**
   - Create API endpoints for report generation and status checking
   - Implement the actual report generation logic

4. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Test the full flow from candidate application to interview completion
   - Verify that passed candidates appear in the recruiter dashboard
   - Test report generation and viewing

## Notes
- The frontend is now more resilient to missing backend fields
- The backend changes are backward compatible with existing data
- The migration script will need to be updated with the correct `down_revision` value before running
